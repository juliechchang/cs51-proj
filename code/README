Instructions for compiling and running our code:

1. change directory into the code folder
2. in the command line, run: corebuild Main.native
	there should be no errors
3. in the command line, run: ./Main.native
	this should create a file called "results.txt" in the same folder
4. open "results.txt" to look at our decision trees and their accuracies
